Of course! This is an excellent and well-structured schema. It's rich with data that can be used to create a wide variety of insightful charts and visualizations for different stakeholders (admins, faculty, and students).

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the kinds of charts and dashboards you can build, categorized by the target audience or purpose.

*   **Average Answer Turnaround Time (TAT) (Line Chart or KPI Card)**
    *   **What it shows:** The average time (in hours or days) from `submitted_at` to `evaluated_at`. This can be tracked over time.
    *   **Data used:** `answers.submitted_at`, `answers.evaluated_at`.
    *   **Why it's useful:** Measures the operational efficiency of the evaluation process and helps set expectations for students.

*   **Subject Popularity (Pie Chart or Bar Chart)**
    *   **What it shows:** The distribution of submitted answers across different subjects.
    *   **Data used:** `answers.subject_id` joined with `subjects.name`.
    *   **Why it's useful:** Informs which subjects are most in-demand, guiding content and faculty recruitment.

*   **Platform-wide Average Ratings (Gauge or Scorecard)**
    *   **What it shows:** The average `student_rating` for all evaluated answers and mentorship sessions.
    *   **Data used:** `answers.student_rating`, `mentorship_sessions.student_rating`.
    *   **Why it's useful:** A key indicator of overall student satisfaction and service quality.

### 2. Financial & Business Intelligence (BI) Dashboard

This dashboard focuses on revenue, sales, and the platform's credit economy.

*   **Revenue Over Time (Bar or Line Chart)**
    *   **What it shows:** Total revenue (`amount_paid`) per day, week, or month. Can be stacked by `plan.type` (one-time vs. recurring).
    *   **Data used:** `orders.created_at`, `orders.amount_paid`, `orders.plan_id` joined with `plans.type`.
    *   **Why it's useful:** Tracks the core financial performance of the business.

*   **Plan Performance (Donut Chart or Table)**
    *   **What it shows:** Which plans are generating the most revenue or have the highest number of purchases.
    *   **Data used:** `orders.plan_id` joined with `plans.name`, `SUM(orders.amount_paid)`.
    *   **Why it's useful:** Helps in optimizing pricing, plans, and marketing efforts.

*   **Credit Economy Balance (Stacked Area Chart)**
    *   **What it shows:** Two lines over time: total credits purchased (`transaction_type = 'purchase'`) versus total credits consumed (`transaction_type = 'consumption'`).
    *   **Data used:** `credit_transactions.created_at`, `credit_transactions.amount`, `credit_transactions.transaction_type`.
    *   **Why it's useful:** Visualizes the flow of credits in the system and helps predict future credit demand.

*   **Subscription Metrics (for recurring plans) (KPI Cards)**
    *   **What it shows:** Key SaaS metrics like Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR), Churn Rate, and Active Subscriptions.
    *   **Data used:** `subscriptions` table (status, period_end) and `plans` table (price, interval).
    *   **Why it's useful:** Essential for understanding the health of a subscription-based business model.

### 3. Faculty Performance Dashboard

This can be a dashboard for admins to manage faculty or for individual faculty members to see their own performance.

*   **Evaluation Speed (Box Plot or Histogram)**
    *   **What it shows:** The distribution of `evaluation_duration_minutes` for a specific faculty member, compared to the average.
    *   **Data used:** `answers.evaluation_duration_minutes`, `answers.assigned_faculty_id`.
    *   **Why it's useful:** Identifies fast and slow evaluators and highlights consistency.

*   **Evaluation Quality (Bar Chart)**
    *   **What it shows:** Average `student_rating` per faculty member.
    *   **Data used:** `answers.student_rating`, `answers.assigned_faculty_id`.
    *   **Why it's useful:** The primary metric for measuring the quality of a faculty's feedback from the student's perspective.

*   **Marking Distribution (Histogram)**
    *   **What it shows:** The distribution of `marks_awarded` by a faculty member for a specific subject.
    *   **Data used:** `answers.marks_awarded`, `answers.assigned_faculty_id`.
    *   **Why it's useful:** Helps identify if a faculty member is a particularly lenient or strict grader compared to their peers.

*   **Active Assignment Queue (Table/List)**
    *   **What it shows:** A simple, interactive list of answers currently assigned to the faculty member, showing submission date, subject, and priority status.
    *   **Data used:** `answers` table, filtered by `assigned_faculty_id`.
